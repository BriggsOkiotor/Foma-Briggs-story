# Opps!!! 
### Sorry... 

My parental misguidance story is not published yet. 

WHY YOU SHOULD READ MY STORY Or LISTEN TO MY SONGS 
1. Because my story informs 60% of my songs. A  motivation about delay, challenges, struggles, limitations, lack, tears, pain, etc. And of course fun and merriment, because in spite  of all,  God was still faithful. Causing me to dance, celebrate and jubilate in the midst of despair.
2. Because my story is a documentation for my children-children. To know and be guided.
3. Because my story might inspire you or  be relative 

Have you ever been to a church and each time you do it seems like every prayer point coming from the altar is actually directed towards you.
Has a friend ever told you to your face " Until your life turns around for good i have no business with your spiritual congregation (church) or any you recommend "?

This is just so you understand my struggles. 


*Story goes live on three criteria*

1. When I settle down maritally 
2. After my “Party Rice” Album drops 
3. When i own my first million Naira
 
*in no other.*

*Feel free to follow and connect with @fomabriggs till criteria is met, before my story goes live.*
